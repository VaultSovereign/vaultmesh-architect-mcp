version: "1.0.0"
description: |
  Formal architecture specification for the VaultMesh MCP digital twin, serving as a "constitution" for synchronized,
  proof-anchored control loops in critical infrastructure. This unifies AI-driven commands, cryptographic state alignment,
  and self-evolving simulations across physical and digital realms.
